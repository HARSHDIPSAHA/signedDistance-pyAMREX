sdf3d — 3D Signed Distance Function Library
============================================

A library for creating and composing 3D signed distance fields (SDFs),
based on Inigo Quilez's distance function collection.

Implemented features
--------------------
- Primitive shapes: Sphere, Box, RoundBox, Cylinder, ConeExact, Torus
- Boolean operations: Union, Intersection, Subtraction
- Transforms: translate, rotate_x/y/z, scale, elongate, round, onion
- Grid sampling: :func:`sample_levelset_3d`
- AMReX MultiFab output: :class:`SDFLibrary3D` (requires pyAMReX 3-D build)
- Example assemblies: :class:`~sdf3d.examples.NATOFragment`,
  :class:`~sdf3d.examples.RocketAssembly`

Quick start
-----------

NumPy mode (no AMReX required)::

    from sdf3d import Sphere3D, Box3D, Union3D, sample_levelset_3d
    import numpy as np

    sphere = Sphere3D(radius=0.3)
    box    = Box3D(half_size=(0.2, 0.2, 0.2)).translate(0.4, 0.0, 0.0)
    shape  = Union3D(sphere, box)

    bounds     = ((-1.0, 1.0), (-1.0, 1.0), (-1.0, 1.0))
    resolution = (64, 64, 64)
    phi = sample_levelset_3d(shape, bounds, resolution)

AMReX mode::

    import amrex.space3d as amr
    from sdf3d import SDFLibrary3D

    amr.initialize([])
    # ... set up geom, ba, dm ...
    lib      = SDFLibrary3D(geom, ba, dm)
    levelset = lib.sphere(center=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), radius=0.3)
    amr.finalize()
